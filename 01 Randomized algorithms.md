monomials  is **an expression that has a single term, with variables and a coefficient**. For example, 2xy is a monomial since it is a single term, has two variables, and one coefficient. 2xy+10 is a binomial

## Polynomial identity testing 
### What is the polynomial identity testing problem? 
A degree d polynomial has at most d roots
	if a polynomial p is not identically zero, then $p(x)=0$ for at most d different x
The **polynomial identity testing (PIT)** problem asks whether a given polynomial $p(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ is identically zero. That is, it checks if $p \equiv 0$ across all possible input values.

 Identity testing is the problem of determining whether a given multivariate [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") is the 0-polynomial
 ![[pics/Pasted image 20241230132435.png]]
### Why can it be reduced to deciding whether a given polynomial is the zero polynomial? 
A polynomial is zero if and only if all its coefficients are zero. Testing whether $p(x) = 0$ for all $x$ reduces to verifying if p evaluates to zero for sufficiently many points. If p evaluates to nonzero at any point, it is not identically zero.

==TODO:snak med albert==
### Assume black-box access to a polynomial $p$ of degree at most $n$: 
You can choose a query point $s$ and get back $p(s)$ as the result of your query.
#### How many points do you have to query in the worst-case in order to find out whether $p$ is the zero polynomial? 
do we know the amount of roots? because if so then
	In the black-box model, p has degree
	$\leq d$. By the **fundamental theorem of algebra**, a nonzero polynomial of degree d has at most d roots. To guarantee detecting a nonzero polynomial, query $p(s)$ at $d+1$ distinct points. If $p(s) = 0$ for all such points, $p \equiv 0$.
If $d$ is unknown, the testing strategy would need to be adjusted, such as by testing over increasingly large sets of evaluation points until sufficient confidence is reached that $p \equiv 0$

**Worst-Case Deterministic Solution**:
- Need to query $n+1$ distinct points to determine if p ≡ 0
- This is because a degree n polynomial could have n roots
- If all $n+1$ queries return $0$, the polynomial must be identically zero
#### How can you recover the coefficients of  n$p$ in this model? 
- Query $p(s)$ at $s = 0, 1, 2, \dots n$
- Use these evaluations to construct the coefficients via **interpolation**, such as using the **Lagrange interpolation formula**.
- Can use $n+1$ queries to recover all coefficients
- Use linear system of equations from evaluations
- Each query gives an equation: $a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n = p(x)$
- Need $n+1$ equations to solve for n+1 coefficients
### How does randomness help in the polynomial identity testing problem? In particular, which success probability can you achieve using randomness?

- **Schwartz-Zippel Lemma**:
    - Choose evaluation point s randomly from a large enough field
    - If p ≢ 0, probability that p(s) = 0 is ≤ d/|F| where:
        - d is the polynomial degree
        - |F| is the field size
- **Success Probability**:
    - Can achieve error probability ≤ 1/2 with just one random query
    - Can reduce error to 2⁻ᵏ by using k independent random queries
    - This is exponentially better than deterministic approach
## Freivalds’ algorithm 
### Describe Freivalds’ algorithm. Make sure to include the following: 
#### What is the purpose of Freivalds’ algorithm? 
To identify whether two matrices,
Given $A,B,C$ is $A\cdot B=C$
	Reformulation: Is AB-C’ the all-zero matrix?
Does NOT compute the product AB, only verifies if a given C equals AB

#### Why is it faster than computing matrix products?
When doing matrix products it takes $n^3$ or theoritacally $n^{2.373}$
	Requires computing all n² entries
**Freivalds' Algorithm**:
- Runs in O(n²) time
- Much faster than actually computing the product
- Trades perfect accuracy for speed
- Only needs to perform matrix-vector multiplications

## Karger’s algorithm: 
### What is a global min-cut in a graph? 
Given a connected undirected graph, a minimum cut or mincut is a smallest subset of edges that disconnects the graph in two connected components
![[pics/Pasted image 20241231115436.png|500]]
### Describe Karger’s algorithm to find a global min-cut in a graph. 
**Edge contraction**
Given a multigraph (a graph that may have multiple edges between any two vertices), an edge contraction of the edge $e=(u,v)$ collapses u and v into one new vertex $w$, removes all edges between $u$ and $v$, but retain all other edges.![[pics/Pasted image 20241231115654.png|500]]
**Karger’s original algorithm**
- Repeat n-2 times: 
	- Uniformly and independently sample an edge in the (multi)graph and contract it. 
- In the end there are only two vertices left. 
  Output the edges between them as the min-cut.
*Key property: we will never make a graph cut smaller. Some cuts vanish, but any cut in a resulting graph is also a cut in the original graph.*

![[pics/Pasted image 20241231115807.png|400]]![[pics/Pasted image 20241231115822.png|400]]
### What is the failure probability of Karger’s algorithm? Sketch an analysis using probability theory and highlight where exactly properties of an assumed min-cut are used in the analysis. 
Let $G=(V,E)$ let $n=|V|$
Pick some mincut C from G with Size K
($i \geq 0$)
$A_{i}=$ The event that one of the mincut edges in C gets contracted during step i
$G$ has $n$ vertices at step $0$. 
We end when we have $2$ vertices left. 
Every contraction removes one vertex from $G$. 
Contractions $= n-2$

$P(A_{i})=\frac{k}{|E_i|}$
Because we know that k is the smallest amount of edges to anyone vertex for G we have that
$|E|\geq \frac{n \cdot k}{2}$
We can therefore say
$$P(A_{i})=\frac{k}{\frac{n_i \cdot k}{2}}=\frac{2}{n_i}$$
$P(A_i)$ being the chance of messing up
$P(\neg A_i)$ being the chance of NOT messing up
$$P\neg (A_{i})=(1-P(A_{i}))=(1-\frac{2}{n_i})$$

The chance of going all n-2 contractions without contracting an edge in C
$$\prod_{i=0}^{n-3}P(\neg A_{i})=(1-\frac{2}{n_i})$$

but what is $n_i$![[pics/Pasted image 20241231142423.png|300]]
![[pics/Pasted image 20241231142456.png]]
$$\frac{(n-2)!\cdot 2}{n!}$$

![[pics/Pasted image 20241231142849.png]]

On a graph with n vertices a single run of kargers algorithm will give the actual min-cut with $\binom{n}{2}^{-1}$

##### Multiple runs of kargers algorithm
$P_{s}\geq \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}$
$P_{f}\leq 1-\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}$
$P(\text{fail})$ for $k$ runs = ${(P_{F})^k}\leq ({1-\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}})^k$
==Math rules==
		$1-x \leq e^{-x}$
		$\binom{n}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\leq n^{2}$
**Proof**
$$\begin{align}
P(\text{fail})
&&\leq ({1-\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}})^{k} \newline
&&\leq ({1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}})^{k}\\
&&= ({1-\frac{1}{n^{2}}})^{k} \leq (e^{\frac{1}{n^{2}}})^{k}
\end{align}
$$
If we set $k=n^2$
$P(\text{fail})\leq (e^{\frac{1}{n^{2}}})^{n^2}=e^{\frac{n^{2}}{n^{2}}}=e^{-1}=\frac{1}{e}$
![[pics/Pasted image 20250102113625.png]]
### Why does the success probability analysis of Karger’s algorithm imply that any graph has at most $\binom{n}{2}$ global min-cuts?


- **Key Insight**:
    - Algorithm succeeds with probability $\binom{n}{2}^{-1}$
    - Each run can find only one specific min-cut
    - If there were more than $\binom{n}{2}$ min-cuts:
        - Sum of probabilities would exceed 1
        - Contradiction!
- **Formal Argument**:
    - Let $m$ be number of distinct min-cuts
    - Each has $\binom{n}{2}^{-1}$ chance of being found
    - Total probability $≤ 1$
    - Therefore: $m ≤ \binom{n}{2}$

## Primality testing -
![[pics/Pasted image 20250103112219.png]]
### What is a strong probable prime?
A strong probable prime (also called a strong pseudoprime) is a number that passes a **strengthened version of the Fermat primality test**. Let's understand what this means step by step.

First, recall *Fermat's Little Theorem*: if $p$ is prime and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then:
	$a^{(p-1)} ≡ 1 (\mod p)$



![[pics/Pasted image 20250103112149.png]]

### What is the repeated squaring algorithm? What is its running time? 
The algo makes use of:
	$a \cdot b \bmod m = (a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m) \mod m$
and the fact that you can split exponents up, and delete some of them when you take them to base 2

## Algebraic algorithms:
### Roughly, what does the DeMillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel lemma say 
is a tool commonly used in probabilistic [polynomial identity testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_identity_testing "Polynomial identity testing"). Identity testing is the problem of determining whether a given multivariate [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") is the 0-polynomial, the polynomial that ignores all its variables and always returns zero. The lemma states that evaluating a nonzero polynomial on inputs chosen randomly from a large-enough set is likely to find an input that produces a nonzero output.
![[pics/Pasted image 20250102144733.png]]

Let's start with a single variable case:

- Say $P(x) = ax + b$ is a degree 1 polynomial ($d=1$)
- If $P$ is not identically zero, it has at most 1 root
- If we pick a random value from F, chance of hitting that root is $\frac{1}{|F|}$
- This matches lemma: $\frac{d}{|F|} = \frac{1}{|F|}$


- Think of it as "hitting a target":
    - Polynomial defines a "surface" of zeros
    - Random point has small chance of landing on this surface
    - Larger field = more space = smaller chance of hitting
    - Higher degree = bigger surface = higher chance of hitting
- Why $\frac{d}{|F|}$ bound?
    - Each variable introduces at most degree d constraints
    - Field size $|F|$ represents total possible values
    - Ratio $\frac{d}{|F|}$ represents this constraint/possibility balance
###### Requirements for Field Choice (Claude)

1. **Size Requirement**:
    - Need |F| > d for meaningful probability bound
    - Larger field = better probability bounds (d/|F| gets smaller)
    - Must accommodate coefficient values from original polynomial
2. **Common Field Choices**: a) **Finite Field GF(p)**
    - Where p is prime
    - Elements: {0, 1, ..., p-1}
    - Choose p > d for desired bound
    - Operations are mod p
    - Good for computer implementations
### What is the difference between the two mathematical concepts ring and field?
A field is a set F and two operations addition + and multiplication * such that
- **Associativity**: $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$. 
- **Commutativity**: $a+b=b+a$ and $a*b=b*a$. 
- **Identities**: Exist element 0 and 1 such that $a+0=a$ and $a*1=a$.
- **Inverses**: For every element a, there exists an additive inverse $–a$ such that $a+(-a)=0$, and if $a≠0$, there is a multiplicative inverse $a-1$ such that $a*a-1=1$. 
- **Distributivity**: $a*(b+c)=(a*b)+(a*c)$ 

If everything above is fulfilled except the criteria that all non-zero elements have a multiplicative inverse, we instead get a (commutative) ring.

### Name one combinatorial problem matrix determinants can be used to solve and describe roughly how it works. 
**Perfect Matching in Bipartite Graphs**
![[pics/Pasted image 20250102153050.png]]
**the determinant**
![[pics/Pasted image 20250102153143.png]]
if the det is not zero

![[pics/Pasted image 20250102153405.png]]
det(A) ≠ 0 iff graph has perfect matching, 
however The issue is that a regular biadjacency matrix A (with just 1s and 0s) won't work because:
1. The determinant could be zero even when a perfect matching exists
2. Several different perfect matchings could cancel each other out in the determinant
```
Consider this bipartite graph with vertices {1,2} and {3,4}: 
1 -- 3 
1 -- 4 
2 -- 3 
2 -- 4 
Its biadjacency matrix would be: 
[1 1] 
[1 1] The determinant is 0, but the graph clearly has perfect matchings!
```

![[pics/Pasted image 20250102155121.png]]
**Determinant and perfect matchings** 
- The determinant of the symbolic matrix is via Leibniz’s formula a sum of signed terms, one for each perfect matching in the graph, given as a product of the variables of the edges in the matching. 
- The determinant is hence a non-zero multivariate and multilinear polynomial when there are perfect matchings in the graph. 

### How computationally hard is it to compute an nxn symbolic matrix determinant with polynomials in several variables as entries with total degree bounded by $O(n)$? How computationally hard is it to compute an nxn numeric matrix determinant with elements from a finite field as entries? 
- Computing the determinant symbolically may require exponential time simply because there may be that many monomials. 
- Computing the determinant numerically after we replace each variable with a scalar from some field is a polynomial time task.

##### Symbolic matrix determinant
**Input:**

- n×n matrix
- Entries are polynomials in multiple variables
- Total degree of each polynomial is O(n)

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Output size can be exponential
    - Each term in determinant comes from n entries
    - Total degree of output polynomial is O(n²)
    - Number of terms can be exponential in n

##### Numeric Matrix Determinant (Finite Field)

**Input:**

- n×n matrix
- Entries are elements from finite field F
- Each entry has fixed size

**Complexity:**

- O(n³) field operations
- Each field operation takes constant time
- Total time complexity: O(n³)
- Space complexity: O(n²)
### Describe one way of computing a numeric determinant.
Gaussian elimination
![[pics/Pasted image 20250103094549.png]]
Running time is O(n³) using field operations.

## Markov chains: 
### What is a Markov chain? 
A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a sequence of events where the probability of each event depends only on the state of the previous event.
Markov chains are memoryless

**Formally, a Markov chain consists of:**

1. A set of states S
2. Transition probabilities $P(i,j)$ representing the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$
3. The Markov property: $P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, ..., X_0 = i_0) = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)$
### What is a stationary solution to a Markov chain? 
A stationary solution (or stationary distribution) $π$ is a probability distribution over the states that remains unchanged when we apply the transition matrix. It's like finding a perfect balance where the system has settled into a stable pattern.

Mathematically, $π$ is a vector that satisfies:

1. $π = πP$ (where P is the transition matrix)
2. $Σπi = 1$ (probabilities sum to 1)
3. $πi ≥ 0$ for all $i$ (all probabilities are non-negative)
### What is the cover time of a random walk on a graph? 
The cover time of a graph is the maximum over all start vertices v in V of the expected time to visit all the vertices in the graph by a random walk starting from v.
> [!Lemma]
> The cover time of a graph **G=(V,E)** is upper bounded by **4|V||E|**
> 


### Show a tight asymptotic upper bound on the cover time of a random walk on an undirected non-bipartite connected graph. 
![[pics/Pasted image 20250103143028.png]]
### Show an example of a strongly connected directed graph in which the cover time is exponential. 
Here's a striking example of how directed graphs can have exponential cover time:

Consider a directed graph with n vertices arranged in a line:
1 → 2 → 3 → ... → n With additional edges:
- From each vertex i > 1, there's an edge back to vertex 1 with probability 1/2
- The forward edge has probability 1/2

In this graph, reaching vertex n requires taking all forward edges in sequence, which happens with probability $(1/2)^{(n-1)}$.  ie the probability of succes with in one go
The expected time to see this sequence is exponential: $2^{(n-1)}$.  
==TODO math ?==
### Describe how the algorithm for 2SAT can be analyzed as a random walk on a graph. What is the graph and what is its cover time?

==TODO graph descripton==

Assume a 2SAT formula with n variables has a satisfying assignment and that the 2SAT random walk algorithm is allowed to run until it finds a satisfying assignment. Then the expected number of steps until the algorithm finds a satisfying assignment is at most $n^2$. 

Hence, if we abort after $2n^2$ steps, we see from Markov’s inequality that the probability that we don’t find an assignment when there is one, is at most ½.
