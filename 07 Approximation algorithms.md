## Formalizing approximation problems
+ What is an NP-optimization problem? 
+ What is the definition of approximation ratio? 
+ What is a PTAS and what is an FPTAS? Which one is more desirable in theory? Give examples for running times that match the definitions of PTAS and FPTAS algorithms.

## Approximating vertex-cover 
Describe the matching-based algorithm for finding a vertex-cover in a graph that is at most twice as large as the minimum vertex-cover. Include the following in your description: 
+ What does the existence of a k-edge matching imply for the minimum size of a vertex-cover? 
+ How does it matter whether you consider maximum matchings or maximal matchings in the algorithm? Which is the better choice? 
+ Give an infinite family of example graphs on which the algorithm indeed outputs only a 2-approximate solution. Also give a family of example graphs on which the algorithm outputs an optimal solution.

## Coloring 3-colorable graphs 
- [ ] math
+ Given a 3-colorable n-vertex graph, show how you can in polynomial time find a proper O(sqrt(n))-coloring of the graph

## Metric problems and TSP 
What does it mean that a graph has metric costs/weights?

+ Define the TSP and argue that it is NP-complete. 
+ Show that TSP remains NP-complete on metric instances. 
+ How do the general TSP and the metric TSP differ in terms of approximability? Argue that the general TSP cannot be approximated within a constant factor unless P=NP.
